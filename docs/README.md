# The Divistant Library for Kubernetes

We create public charts for a few applications, provided by [Divistant](https://divistant.com), ready to launch on Kubernetes using [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).

## TL;DR

```bash
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.divistant.com/divistant
$ helm search repo divistant
$ helm install my-release divistant/<chart>
```
